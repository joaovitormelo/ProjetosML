# ProjetosML

Projects of Machine Learning for learning.

## Supervised Learning

### Wines Classifier

- #### Introduction
A supervised learning project to built a classifier for the variety of a wine based on its description. Original: [Wines Classifier](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/nlp-tutorial-text-classification). The project intends to compare two approaches for that task: Naive Bayes, a classical Machine Learning algorithm, and Deep Learning, a technique that has gained great notoriety in the last years.

- #### Technologies
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=pt-br)
  - [Keras](https://keras.io/)

- #### Results
  - The Naive Bayes model obtained an accuracy of 62.55%.
  - The Deep Learning model was able to reach 76.45%.
  - Thus, we were able to visualize how models like Deep Learning can deliver the same performance or even outcome traditional models.
